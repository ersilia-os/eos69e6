    "Description": [
        "Based on a molecule's pharmacophore, this model generates new molecules de-novo to match the pharmacophore. Internally, pharmacophore hypotheses are generated for a given ligand. A graph neural network encodes spatially distributed chemical features and a transformer decoder generates molecules."
