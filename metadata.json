    "Title": "Pharmacophore-guided molecular generation",
    "Description": "Based on a molecule's pharmacophore, this model generates new molecules de-novo to match the pharmacophore. Internally, pharmacophore hypotheses are generated for a given ligand. A graph neural network encodes spatially distributed chemical features and a transformer decoder generates molecules.",
